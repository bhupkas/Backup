Euler tour: Exists only when every vertex has even degree

Writing Euler tour: part 9 np completeness	slide 9
Euler path --> Starting and ending point may not be the same 

In an Euler-Tour tree, we store the Euler tour of a represented tree in a balanced binary search
tree (BST). For some represented tree, each visit to a node in that treeâ€™s Euler tour corresponds
