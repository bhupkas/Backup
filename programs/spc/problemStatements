1.
	The notion of similarity of two strings is defined as the length of their longest common subsequence. 
	You are given a string consisting of letters A, B, C, D . You need to find another string consisting of those four letters and of the same length as the given string, that is least similar to the given string. 
	Note that it does not mean that string should necessarily have atleast one of the A , B , C , D. Only constraint is , string should not contain any character other than A , B , C , D.
	
	Input : T : test cases (T <= 20)
			every line has one string (size of string >= 1 && <= 1000)
	Ouput : any string as mentioned above. 

2. 	given n sticks in a plane. You have to partition these into triangles such that sum of area of triangles is maximum. (Note that no two triangles can have common vertices)
n <= 15. 
	input: T : test cases (T <= 5)
			every line contains n .
			then in every line length[i] denotes the length of ith stick. 
	Ouput: for each test case find out the maximum possible area (error <= 1e-6 is accpeted)
			
	Definition: an triangle could be constructed if a , b, c has property that sum of any two sides should be greater than other one.
	for finding area
	
3.  find largest number less than N/2 which is coprime to N.
	input : T : test  cases (T <= 1000)
		every line contains n >= 1 && n <= 10000000;
	Ouput: 
			for each test case
			if such numbers exists output that otherwise output -1.

4. Given a road network with n cities and m roads between those n cities (n <= 100000 && m <= 100000). You want to find out smallest connected network which should contain all 
the vertices and cost of product of all the edges should be minimum.
	input T: test cases (T <= 100)
			n and m .
			next m lines will have a , b , c. which denotes that a and b are connected with edge of cost c. (c >= 10 && c <= 1000000000000 && c will always be power of 2) (a >= 1 && a <= n) && (b >= 1 && b <= n)
	output :
			output log_2 of the cost of product of all the edges in the smallest network.
			As value of product can be increased too much. So instead output log value.
			
5. Given an array of n (n <= 100000) numbers. You will be N opeartions (N <= 100000) query or update operations. each query operation will be of kind , "query a b" , output of which should be no of  prime numbers in the range a to b.
	each upadate opeartions which will of type "update a b" , which means value of array[a] = b;
	
	Input : T : no of test cases (T <= 5)
		n , N
		next n lines will contain elements of the array.
		next N lines will have query or update operations as mentioned.

	Ouput:
		as mentioned above.

6. Given a polynomial a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ............... + a_n x^n. find no of integer roots of this polynomial. (n <= 10000 and a_0 <= 10^6).
	input : T : no of test cases (T <= 1000)
		n + 1 coefficients of the polynomial
	Output:
		no of integer roots of the polynomial
	
7.	Given an array a of n elements. Find out the maximum value of the following expression:
		| a[i]^2 - a[j]^2)| + |5 * ( i ^ 2 – j ^ 2) |.
		size of array <= 10^6. 
	Input : T : no of test cases (T <= 1000)
		next T line will have : n 
			Next line will contain all the n elements of the array.
	Output: 
		as mentioned in the problem

8. Break strings into min no of palindromic continuous substrings.
			find out min no of such palindromic substrings
		input : T : test cases (T <= 200)
				next T lines contain a string s (length of s <= 1000)
		Output : as given in the problem statement.


9. Given a matrix A[n][n]  n <= 1000 , Find out the determinant of matrix modulo p.
	
10. Given an array of n elements. (n <= 100000) , given m pairs i , j which means that i and j indices are swappable. Find out the lexicographically smallest permutation that could be generated by these swaps.

11. Given n numbers. Any two number are called brothers if they have some digit common.
		Find out no of pairs which are brothers.
		Input : T : no of test cases 
			n <=10^6
			then next n line contains a[i] >= 1 && a[i] <= 10^18
		Output: no of such pairs as mentioned in the problem statement.

12. Given two sequence of operations on  a database. operations will of type of read and write.
Find out no of ways you can interleave those sequences such that elements of a particular sequence should be in increasing order.
		Input : T : no of test cases
		next T lines contain n and m (n denotes no of opeartions in the first sequence and m denotes no of opeartions in the second sequence)
		Output:
			as stated in the example

13. Find out how many numbers between a and b have their sum of digits divisible by p. p >= 1 && p <= 1000
	a and b <= 10^100

14. Given an array of n elements. (n <= 100000) , given m pairs i , j which means that i and j indices are swappable. Find out the lexicographically smallest permutation that could be generated by these swaps.

15. Given three strings s ,t , w. You have to replace every occurrence of t in s by w. Resulting string
should not have contain t in it. If it is possible to do replacements in such way , return “YES”;
otherwise return “NO".
	Input: T : no of test cases (T <= 100)
		then follows three strings s  , t , w (size of all string would be <= 10^5)
	Output:
			YES or NO depending on the case.
