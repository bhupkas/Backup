	given n sticks in a plane. You have to partition these into triangles such that sum of area of triangles is maximum. (Note that no two triangles can have common vertices)
n <= 15. 
	input: T : test cases (T <= 5)
			every line contains .
			then in every line length[i] denotes the length of ith stick. 
	Ouput: for each test case find out the maximum possible area (error <= 1e-6 is accpeted)
			
	Definition: an triangle could be constructed if a , b, c has property that sum of any two sides should be greater than other one.
	for finding area

	0 <= length[i] <= 10^3
