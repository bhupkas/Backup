Consider the 3 types of operations:
(1) Take out two black balls. 
The number of black balls will decrease by 2, and the number of white balls will increase by 1.
(2) Take out two white balls.
The number of white balls will decrease by 1.
(3) Take out one black ball and one white ball.
The number of white balls will decrease by 1.
We can see that during the process, the parity of the number of black balls never changes. So if B is even, the last ball cannot be black. If B is odd, the last ball must be black.
The time complexity is O(1). The space complexity is O(1).
