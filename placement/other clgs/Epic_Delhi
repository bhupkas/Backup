Epic Systems
4 sections.
A. Speed Calculations: 2 mins 10 questions, attend as much as u can.
B. Apti: 12 questions
C. Technical: 20 questions, based on some newly defined language.
section B,C did not have any sectional time limit. But you need to finish these 3 sections within 75 mins. You will be judged on speed and accuracy. So try do complete as fast as possible.
D. Coding: 4 questions, 2 hrs. But again you will judged based on speed and accuracy. Write functions. Pseudo codes are allowed. Its like a online version of pen and paper coding. Questions of this section was different for everyone. I am sharing my questions.
#1. Suppose all months have 30 days. There's 12 months in a year. February would have 31 days in a Leap year. condition for leap year is defined as (year%40==0) is leap, (year%200==0) is not leap, (year%1000==0) is leap. Given a date as MM/DD/YYYY, find the next Leap Day.
#2. Print matrix in spiral order. 
#3. U have to print all possible combinations of phone numbers. The length of the number will be given. Also 3 digits will be given, which can not be used. No two consecutive digits would be same. A number containing 4 would always have 4 in the beginning.
#4. Given a number, get all possible substrings using the digits of this number and if the product of digits in one subset is same with the another, then return false, else return true.
e.g. 345={3,4,34,45,35,345}
products are{3,4,5,12,20,15,60} hence true
3426={3,4,2,6,34,42,26,....}
product ={3,4,2,6,12,8,12,..} hence false. (products of 34 and 26 are same)
