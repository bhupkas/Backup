1 hr 50mcq

1 hr 2 coding

1) http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/

2) doosra to check if a given pair of strings are pseudo anagrams
and how do they define pseudo anagrams ?

rearrangement of alphabetic letters along with

non alphabetic chars do not matter

eg asd , dsa67

are true

not asdf , asde

gives false
basically anagrams , ignoring non alphabets
right ?

yup
maintain the count ..
will suffice .

yup

MCQ:

No DBMS 
Networks + OS + Apti + OOPs

like which of the following is suitable for udp

is type ka

oops pe ek sawal tha

dynamic polymorphism

no wait...

2 questions

on dynamic polyorphism

*polymorphism

ek ka toh lamba sa code tha

uska output batana tha

basic funda tha ki kaun sa constructor invoke hoga

phirr ek pointers pe tha

exact yaad nai hai

but virtual functions ke funde pe tha


most of them on virual functions, dynamic polymorphism type ke

os pe ek numerical tha

paging ka

networks general funde hi the

 so basically OOPs in detail and rest basic .



IIT KGP citrix written questions.
(1 hour apti followed by another 1 hour coding(2 que))
1.Dont remember the actual question but it was related to 8 connectedness, i.e given a matrix of 1's and 0's you need to find number of clusters of 1's. cluster -> for any cell in matrix every 8 adjacent cell for that cell will be in the same cluster.
2. Given two strings check whether one is psuedo-anagram of other.
conditions:-
(i)only letters need to be considered.
e.g. abcd and bc-"ad? are psuedo-anagrams.
(ii)case-insensitive.
e.g. abCd and BCaD are psuedo-anagrams.
(iii)repetition of characters is allowed.
e.g. abcd and bccaaad are psuedo-anagrams.
aptitude:
some c, c++ programs,os,quant apti, n/w.......not tough
