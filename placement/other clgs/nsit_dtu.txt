Adobe Experience - Archit
The Written round was of 2 hrs 45 mins and had 3 sections: Quant and LR, C ,Engineering.
The first section was pretty typical.Quant was very easy, but LR was a bit tough and required time. There were 45 minutes for Quant(30 questions) and LR(15 questions).I would suggest that spend 15 minutes on LR and after that start doing quant and then you can come back to LR if the time permits. The next two sectons start immediately after the first section finishes. The questions were pretty typical,like finding gcd, reverse linked list etc.
 
After that,the shortlisted candidates were invited to Adobe's office in Noida.
 
Interview Round 1:
 
1.Some questions of OS like what is virtual memory,difference between thread and process.
2.You are given a pointer to an array of pointers.Allocate memory for this(size of array is given,along with type of pointer).I was asked to optimize to use 1 malloc only and rearrange the pointers. Some variations were done as to what will change if pointers are pointing to char, or if instead of giving type of pointer,only a pool of memory is given.
3.There is a NXM grid of pixels,and each pixel is represented by 3 bits,1 each for R,G and B color values.You are given the address of beginning of grid in a character pointer,and a position x,y on the grid.You have to change that positions bits to some other given bits.
 
Interview Round 2:
Only 1 question was asked in this round.
 
1.You are given a long essay of words, and two strings A and B. You have to replace every occurence of A in the Essay wih B.Wrote the full code.
 
Interview Round 3:
This was taken by a senior technical lead.
 
1.Find all permutation of a given string.
2.You are given an infinitely big number which is coming as a stream of bits(0 and 1), and when a 2 comes,it signifies the end of the number.You have to tell if the number is a multiple of 5.
3.Some OOPS concepts,like virtual function,static function etc.
 
HR Round:
Was asked typical HR questions.
Dunno what went wrong here,was rejected after this.

Adobe Experience - Vipul
 
Written round: Same as Archit & Aarushi
 
F2F 1st round
He first asked me to tell me about myself.
 
1. OS intensive questions (about 35-40 Mins)
He asked me about Virtual Memory, Virtual Memory Addressing, Limits of Virtual memory (Dependence on the System) , Usage of Virtual Memory, Paging, Allocation of memory to a process, Process' view of its own memory.
 
Then he asked me this question.
Program A:
...
int a=10;
int* ptr = &a;
 
//then we write the value of ptr in a file F1
 
wait();
...
 
Program B:
...
int *ptr1;
//read the value of address saved in file F1 by Program A into ptr1
 
*ptr1=20;
 
wait();
...
 
He asked what will be the effect on the value of variable 'a' in Program A after this with proper explanation.
 
2. Design a system for storing a large no. of images which can be searched by a user on the basis of Height and Width of the image. He told me to design the Data Structure that I'll use, how do I process the queries from the users and How do I add more Images to my search system?
 
3. There is an image of having NXM pixels, and each pixel is represented by 3 bits,1 each for R,G and B color values. You are given the pixels correspoding to the vertices of a trapezoid in the image and you have to copy the trapezoid part into a blank image.Then he changed the question to: Make all the pixels that are outside of the smallest rectangle that encloses the trapezoid in the new image to r=0, g=0 and b=0 values.
 
I answered 1st and 3rd questions well, except the 2nd where my answer was not good.
 
 
F2F 2nd round
 
1. Asked me about a project of mine. Interrupted me in between when I was explaining it to him.
 
2. How to detect a cycle in a graph?
 
3. You are given a mXn 2-D array which is obviously 1-D allocated in the memory, with each element having a size of 3 bytes. This array is 4-byte padded in each row i.e. if the size of a row is not a multiple of 4 bytes, some extra bytes are added in the end of the row to make it a multiple of 4 (these bytes contain junk values and are not to be read). You are given a char* which points to the start of the array.
- Find the size of the array.
 
You are given a function Binarize() which takes the byte corresponding to a color and returns a bit. Each of the 3 bytes correspond to the R,G,B values of a color, separate them, pass them to the function Binarize() and then store these bits(in the order r,g,b) in another 2-D array which is 8-bit(1-byte) padded in each of the rows.
 
I was asked to code this. I was not able to figure out in time how to store the bits in the second array with a 8-bit padding.
 
4. What is virtual memory?
What will happen if we do a 2GB malloc in a program when we have 1GB RAM?
 
Adobe experience - Rishul Aggarwal
 
Written round has already been described.
 
F2F Round 1: 
 
1. Tell me about yourself. What are your favourite subjects?
2. What is the difference between threads and processes?
3. For uniprocessor environment, will you use multithreading or multiprocessing? Why? Give real life example.
4. Write the code to delete a node from a BST. Assume node exists in the given tree. (He wanted code and  not     algorithm or pseudo-code). Structure of the node was:
 
struct node { void* data; struct node*left,*right;};
5. How will you free the node in above code while deleting the node? How to free the void pointer? What if void pointer points to another pointer or data structure? How will you ensure no dangling references are left?
 
F2F Round 2:
 
1. Tell me about yourself. What are your favourite subjects? What is the difference between threads and processes?
2. What projects have you done? 
3. Questions on both projects I had done. Details and implementation and applications.
4. A binary tree has following structure: struct node { int data; struct node*left,*right,*next}; . For every node, next points to the next node in its level. For last nodes of each level next is NULL. Write a code to populate all next pointers. Expected complexity was O(n) Time and space was not mentioned. 
5. Can we do previous question recursively?
 
Points to be noted: Adobe asks a lot of OS questions along with pointers in C and OOPS concepts. But data structure questions and algorithms can also be asked so be prepared. For written test, do quant first and then do LR section. Please do have a look at previous year questions for the C/Engineering paper. I had done all prev year papers and I even remembered answers to the questions which were repeated. (Close to 60-70% questions were repeated).
 
 
Amazon experience - Rishul Aggarwal
 
Online test had 20 MCQs & 2 coding questions (same as Vipul). I did both questions and around 14-15 MCQs correctly. There was negative marking in MCQs. In general, do both questions and more than 10 MCQs correctly to get shortlisted. 
 
F2F Round 1 (50 minutes) :
 
1. Tell me about yourself.
2. What projects have you done?
3. Questions related to my project. Asked to implement a variation of my project in C. Write code for it.
4. In a stream of words, you need to find the top 10 trending words at any given instant. (similar to Twitter). Asked to provide only algorithm/idea. Further optimizations were asked.
 
F2F Round 2 (45 minutes) :
 
1. Tell me about yourself.
2. What have you failed at?
3. Given a sorted array containing only 0s & 1s, find number of zeros in the array. (Serious question, not a joke :P).
4. I solved above question iteratively, then he asked me to do it recursively (strange!).
5. As you know the main memory is limited, so instead of keeping all records in the database in the memory, we keep only certain number of most recently accessed records in the memory. Give an algorithm to find a record in the database when a query comes. Also you need to keep the main memory updated with most recently accessed records (This is simply an LRU cache).
 
Points to be noted: Do GeeksForGeeks and get employed at Amazon. As simple as that.
 
CodeNation experience - Rishul Aggarwal

3. In a binary tree, print all connected paths having sum of nodes lying on the path equal to k.
 
F2F Round 3(60 minutes)
 
This was the most intense round & I was asked everything that I could possibly think of. Operating systems, DBMS & since I mentioned about interest in Machine Learning, he delved deep into it & the discussion carried on for about 15-20 minutes. In OS, he asked about paging, fragmentation. In dbms, normalization, give real life example of 3NF. About my projects also there was some discussion. Some discussion about competitive programming, what errors you face in it, types of runtime errors, why segmentation fault, why recursion can overflow stack, is recursion machine dependent. All in all a very intense round.
 
 
DE Shaw experience- Rishul Aggarwal
 
Written test: There were three papers of 60 minutes in total. Each paper was of 20 min duration. You can’t come back to a paper after 20 min.
 
First paper had 20 aptitude questions. Second paper had 20 questions on C/Java/OS/DBMS & algorithms. Third paper had an algorithmic question for which algo or code was to be written.

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/directi-interview-questions/
 
Out of about 100 students, 12(who solved atleast 1 question) were selected for further interviews.
 
F2F round 1(90 minutes) :
Some were called for F2F interview and others for telephonic interview. I gave telephonic interview.
1. Given an array representing height of vertical bars, each bar has unit width and are placed consecutively. We have to find such 2 bars so that when we remove all the bars between them and fill the empty space with water, the area covered by water between them is maximized. For example :  {8, 6, 3, 6, 5, 9, 4, 6}

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
________________________________
0 1  2  3  4  5 6  7
Answer is 0th and 7th bars, area would be 36.
I gave O(n logn) solution and he was satisfied with it. Linear time solution is also possible.
2.  Two players are playing a game, they have two piles of stones having n and m stones. A player can pick any number of stones(not 0) from any of the 2 piles, or equal number of stones from both piles. If a player cannot make a move he loses. Determine the winner.
I solved it with DP.
 
F2F round 2(90 minutes) :
1. Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, find order of characters in the language.
Input:  words[] = {"caa", "aaa", "aab"}
Output: Order of characters is 'c', 'a', 'b'
I gave topological sorting based solution.
 
2. Given n paintings of equal height but different widths. We are provided with their starting and ending positions
and they have been painted on the wall in the order of their index in input. Find how many painitngs are visible.
For example :
Let there be 5 paintings - (1, 4), (2, 6), (8, 10), (3 4), (7 10)
4 paintings will be visible at the end.
I first gave an O(n*W) : time and O(n*W) : space solution, where W is maximum width of wall. But width of wall could be as large as range of int. Then I gave O(n*n) and O(n*log n) solutions just at the end of interview :/
 
Directi Experience - Ujjwal Relan
Directi conducted an online test and interview process for all those who went to ICPC Regionals, for both internship and full time recruitment.
1st Round : Online Coding Round across multiple colleges
Two questions in 1.5 hrs. At least one of them needs to be solved completely to qualify for the interviews.
2nd Round : Telephonic Interview (Code on Collabedit)
1. Rank of k-length substring is given as:
eg: If given a string, ABCTAC then rank of 4-length substrings,
ABCT - 1234
BCTA - 2341
CTCA - 3431
Explanation: There are 4 characters in it : A,B,C,T so lexicographically their rank is 1,2,3,4 and hence the rank of the above substrings.
Find the no of k-substrings with a given rank pattern.
2. Write the formula for total number of set bits in numbers from 1 to n.
3.Given a binary tree, find the no of univalued subtrees.
          7
        /     \
   6          5
/     \       /    \
6     6  8      3
It has 5 univalued subtrees (4 leaf nodes + 1 subtree with 3 ‘6’)
 
3rd Round : Telephonic Interview (Code on Collabedit)
1. Given size N, write the code to find the number of strings that can be formed using ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ provided:
a) At most 1 ‘b’ is used.
b) Not more than 2 consecutive ‘a’s are used.
2. Given a graph, Bottleneck for a pair of vertices is defined as :
Minimum of Maximum edge of each path from source to destination
Determine the bottleneck for each pair of vertices.
3. Complexity of DFS for finding all possible paths from a given point.
4th Round: Face to face interview
1. Coding Question:
Given a dictionary of words, give the new order of characters as per the new dictionary.
eg: 
efa
efb
esa
afa
fee
baa
saf
This tells that the order of characters is e,a,f,b,s.
This can be done using topological sort but mainly the code for creating the edges was required. (Basic Recursive Solution was required)
2. Coding Question:
Normally a keypad has keys 0-9 each with three characters on it.
Weight of a character is defined as number of times a key needs to be pressed to type that character. For eg: if abc is present on a key then we need to press the key twice to type ‘b’ so weight of ‘b’ is 2.
Given the frequency of each character as required by user.
eg:
a 2
b 5
c 1
and so on
Rearrange these characters amongst the keys such that summation of weight*frequency over all characters are minimised.
Constraints:
1. Each key must have atleast 1 character. It can have more than 3 chars after rearranging.
2. The lexographical order of characters must be maintained for each key i.e a key can have a,d,f but they will present as adf not as fda or any other sequence.
3. Coding Question:
There are two stacks with m and n coins respectively. Two players play a game with the following possible operations:
a) Either pick some coins from stack1, or
b) Pick some coins from stack 2, or
c) Pick equal no of coins from both the steps.
Given values of m and n, tell who would win given both players play OPTIMALLY.
Final Interview Round (Skype Interview and Code on Collabedit)
1. In depth Project Discussion: Aim of the project and what role I had in my projects.
2. Coding Question:
Given heights of n trees and a certain amount of wood, reqWood, tell the maximum height at which all trees can be cut so that I get atleast reqWood amount of wood.
For eg
Heights:
6 (no of trees)
4 1 2 3 10 7   (heights)
5 (reqWood)
Output
6
I will get 4 units of wood from the tree with height 10 and 1 unit of wood from tree with height 7, if I cut at a height of 6.
3. Detailed discussion of Google Maps:
a) How are nodes identified in Google Maps?
b) When Source and Destination are entered into the google maps, how is the path shown instantly?
c) If precomputation is done, then what exactly is kept precomputed at the backend?
d) If source and destination are known, is it required to apply Dijkstra in all four directions?
What optimisations can be performed in this?
Basically, possible optimisations and methods used in Google Maps were discussed.
4. OS based questions:
int balance; //global
func1(int amt)
{
balance+=amt;
}
This function is called by multiple threads. What can be the problem with this code?
What can be done to overcome it? Modify the code to counter the same.
5. DBMS based questions:
a. SQL query to find second maximum value of an attribute.
b. What are Indices?
c. What kinds of Indices are used?
d. What are the uses of B+ Trees?
e. Can B+ tree indexed on Name handle queries like find names beginning with “Ar”?
f. Can it handle queries like names ending with “al”? What can be done to handle this case?
g. How can one index based on two attributes, given that there is an equal probability of getting a query for either of the attributes?

1st round was a written round having three sections-
# LR and Quant (45 minutes, 45 questions (30 quant+15 LR))
# Rest 2 sections contains questions on C o/p, some questions like reversing a Linked List, Given a number in form of a binary string, return its 2's complement in the binary string form itself, A recursive fn. was given having printf() at several points, write its o/p, there was 1 question on Microprocessors where a assembly language code was given and we had to predict the functioning of the code, 1 question was on boolean algebra  etc...
 
The most important thing is if u dont clear the cutoff for LR and Quant section, they will not check the other two sections.
 
Interview Round 1:
1. Tell me about urself
2. Discussion on my project
3. consider following code:
 
int a ;
int main()
{ printf("%u\n",&a);
}
 
what will be the o/p of the above code if we run it 5 times, will it be same every time or not?
I told him if Run time binding  is done then the o/p will be different...
4. consider following code:
int main()
{ int  a=10;
fun();
a=5;
printf("%d\n",a);
}
void fun()
{ // do something
}
he ask me to write fun() in such a way that the o/p of above code is 10 instead of 5.
I gave a solution:
void fun()
{ printf("10\n");
exit(1);
}
then he told me to do it without exit()...
 
The idea is to change the return address on the stack. To do this we have to declare a local variable in fun() as this variable will be created on stack. Then by getting the address of this variable and adding in it the  size of varibale we will get the address of return address. Then modify the return address by adding in it the size of instruction a=5;
The intrvwr told me that the idea is correct but there is still some problem...
5.  Given an unsorted array having all the elements distinct except one element that repeats exactly n/2 times,          return that element using minimum no. of comparisons.
 
Interview Round 2:
1. Tell me about urself
2.  Given starting and ending coordinates (2-d) of two line segaments, tell whether the two line segaments intersect or not?
3.  Remove all the spaces in given string and change lowercase letters to uppercase.
4.  Reverse words in given string . eg(Hello boy ->  olleH yob)
5.  Set the nth bit of a unsigned number and return the number. This question has a trick, the fn. should return the number as unsigned, because  if u return it simply is int, it will be assumed as signed and the value may become negative.
 
Interview Round 3:
1. Why Should we hire u?
2. A class declaration was given, write its copy constructor. The given class had a member as char *p, so be careful with deep copy and shalow copy.
3. Some C declarations were given and he asked me the meanings of them.
4. Design a elevator.
 
Interview Round 4:
1. Tell me about urself.
2. Discussion on my projects.
3. Both of my projects were on image processing, so he gave me to write a code to check whether the given two images are same or not.
4. He asked me to write my own malloc() and free() , the restriction was that the malloc should not give memory than a given amount at any time.
I suggest u to write free()'s implementation of ur own for practice.
 
Do prepare OS well to get into Adobe :)

Written Round : Same as Vipul
 
Interview Round 1:
1. Tell me about urself, discussion on my project.
2. Given a number, print all the numbers that sum upto the given no.
eg. given no.=4
o/p:
1+1+1+1
1+1+2
1+3
2+2
there should be no repitition (eg if  1+1+2 has already printed, then 1+2+1 or 2+1+1 should not get printed).
3. Given an unsorted array, rearrange the array in such a way that the elements satisfy following property:
a[1] is less than a[2], a[2] is greater than a[3], a[3] is less than a[4], a[4] is greater than a[5] and so on...
 
Interview Round 2:
1. Tell me about urself.
2. Deep discussion on my internship's project, he wanted to know the goals of my project.
3. Given a sorted array of 0's and 1's, count the number of 0's. I told him O(logn) approach. Then he asked me why this approach takes O(logn) time. Then he asked me to write both recursive and iterative versions of it.
4. Given two binary trees, check whether they are morror images of each other.
 
Interview Round 3:
 
1. Tell me about ureslf.
2. Discussion on OS concepts for 15-20 minutes. One question was: what is the maximum size of Virtual memory?
3. Given 100 songs numbered from 1-100, and given fn. rand(n) that returns a random integer b/w 1-n, write a code to select songs one by one in a random order such that none of the song is repeated untill all the songs have been played atleast once.
4. Given a file containing words, do preprocessing on this file such that if i give another word, the code should print all its anagrams from the file. The preprocessing step may take as much time as needed but after that, every time a word is given , its anagrams should be printed in minimum time.
 
Interview Round 4 (HR + Tech):
1. Tell me about urself.
2. How were the previous intrvws?
3. Why do u want to join Amazon?
4. Then he gave 3 problems:
# How can we know  the time it takes b/w the time we enter a url and the time the page gets loaded.
# Given HTML or PHP(in whatever language a web page is written (i dont know web d , so i dont remember what language he told me) ) codes of two web pages, find out where these pages differ from each other? He asked me to design a Data Structure for the same. He also taught me how a web page is written as i dont know HTML.
# Design a Data Structure to find out maximum selling product(in last 7 days) in each category on Amazon's website.
