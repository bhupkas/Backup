Epic IIT Madras on Oct 26'14:
Common: (Speed and accuracy Test)
You can't lose focus from the current test web page.
Section-A : 2 Min- 10 Questions 
Section B:- Quants
Section C: Technical
Section D: 4 Programming assignments (Algo coding in c, c++ )
No on line compiler.
My Questions:
1. To print the perfect ordering string of length N.
eg "achq" is one of the example of length 4, since a< c<h<q in lexical order.
2. In a given string replace article 'a' by article 'the',
eg. "He is a citizen of America"
and: "He is the citizen of America""
