1. In a party n guests are there, some guests talk with only some other.
Input given in form of matrix, where i,j denotes if i talks with j
Guests will talk only in pairs
Find the max number of pairs possible
undirected graph hai
2. 
Rectangle-
range is given of sides, like(l,k) which means the length of corresponding side will lie b/w l and k
Input :
Ranges of each side given:
base b1, b2
side 1 - s1,s2
side 2 - s3,s4
side1 and side 2  are the heights of quadrilateal formed using base as given
Now we need to find the range of 4th side, which will form the quadrilateral
