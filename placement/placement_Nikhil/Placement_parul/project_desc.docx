IBM Intern:

My task was to study and explore opportunities for further optimization to the code base developed by Scientists at IBM TJ Watson lab for BFS of large random graph on BlueGene/P. 2^38 vertices with average degree of 16.

I did two major optimizations-

1) Number of vertices in start and end levels of BFS are negligible as compared to middle levels (Fig 1).
- Implemented a dynamic strategy for row communication based on no. of vertices visited in each level.
- 30% gain in performance by sending the index numbers rather than whole bitmap

2) Edge traversal for large problem size when run on less nodes takes more than 65% of total time of BFS.
- Observed that only 20% of edges decompressed are actually used in BFS.
- 5-10% gain in performance for problems run on less number of nodes.

Other details are confidential.

Application: 
Large scale graph exploration finds application in Social Networks, and Medical informatics.

Challenges:
Study of a large code base of more than 6000 lines. 
The performance scales linearly with the number of graph vertices. A big challenge!


SURGE
49 metabolic and non-metabolic pathways for Gallus gallus (chicken) in
KEGG database.

Application:
To test genes present at any organ by factoring down the possibilities.

Challenges:
Large size of genome  ~millions of length (gene bases)







Winter School
Best Part: 
1) Integrated two classifiers => Adaboost as feature extraction ¡ú SVM as classification (using weighted voting of classifiers)
2) Came up with new features-
Frequency at which energy is maximum in spectogram to distinguish Happy and Angry (2nd best feature)
fbank ? came up as best feature to distinguish sad from other emotions.

Applications:
human-robotics interfaces, forensics, smart call centers, 

Challenges:
1) Speech and emotion type varies with regions and languages. So, testing and training sets has to be of same types (languages)

Future work:
To build on real data
