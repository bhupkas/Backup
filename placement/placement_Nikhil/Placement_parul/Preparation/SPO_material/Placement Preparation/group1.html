One morning is starts to snow at a
constant rate.  Later, at 6:00am, a snow plow sets out to clear a
straight street.  The plow can remove a fixed volume of snow per
unit time, in other words its speed it inversely proportional to
the depth of the snow.  If the plow covered twice as much
distance in the first hour as the second hour, what time did it
start snowing?  </a><a href="http://mathproblems.info/prob2a.htm">(Answer)</a>,

If you drew a dot on the edge of a wheel
and traced the path of the dot as the wheel rolled one complete
revolution along a line, then the path formed would be called a cycloid (shown 
above), combining
both forward and circular motion.  What is the length of the path
formed by one complete revolution?  Assume the wheel has a radius of 1.

There are two envelopes in front of you each with a non-zero number.  
You will receive an amount of money equal to the final envelope you 
choose.  You are informed one has twice as much money as the other.  You
 are then allowed to select either envelope.  After you select one and 
before opening it you are given the option to change your mind and 
switch to the other one?  You think to yourself that if your envelope 
has x dollars there is a
50% chance the other one has x/2 dollars and a 50% chance it has 2x 
dollars.  The expected return, you compute, is .5[.5x +
2x]=1.25x which seems like a favorable gamble.  Do you switch and
why?  Assume you are neither risk averse nor risk prone, in other
words you will take any good gamble and avoid any bad one.

A town consists of only one street in the form of a circle.  The town 
authorities give out four licenses for a particular kind of business.  The 
inhabitants of the town live in equal density along the circle and will always 
go to the closest business for what they need.  Business A gets to choose a 
location first, then business B, then C, and finally D.  Each business 
desires to carve out as much business for themselves as possible but each 
knows the others all have the same motive.  Assume that if a business is 
indifferent between locating in two different sections of the circle it 
will choose a section at random.  Also assume that the business that 
goes last will choose a location in the middle of the largest (or one of 
the largest) sections.  
Where should business B choose relative to the location of A?

<strong>Logical reasoning and basic math required.  </strong>
Three men walk into a motel and ask for a room.  The desk clerk
says a room is $30 so 
each man pays $10 towards the cost.  Later, the clerk realizes he
made a mistake, that 
the room should have been $25.  He calls the bell boy over and
asks him to refund the 
other $5 to the three men.  The bellboy, not wanting to mess with
a lot of change dividing 
the $5 three ways, decides to lie about the price, refunding each
man $1 and keeping the 
other $2 for himself.  Ultimately each man paid $9 towards the
room and the bellboy got 
$2, totaling $29.  But the original charge was $30, where did
the extra $1 go?

Joe's happiness is proportional to the function w<sup>2</sup>*c (w squared * c), where 
w stands for daily consumption of glasses of wine, and c stands of 
daily consumption of number of cigars.  Wine costs $3 a glass and 
cigars cost $2 each.  His daily budget for both is $100.  How should 
he divide his money between wine and cigars to maximize his 
happiness?  Assume he does not have to buy integer numbers of either 
cigars or wine.

Assume you have a checker board with 7 rows and infinite columns. 
You can 
place checkers on only the first 2 rows initially.  Then you may
jump other 
checkers up, down, right, and left but <u>not diagonally</u>. 
The 
goal is to get as high a row as possible.  For example you can
get to the 
second level with four checkers like this:<br>
<pre>       Initial 
Level   setup   Turn 1  Turn 2  Turn 3
-----  -------  ------  ------  ------
  2                               a
  1                 d       d
  0      abc      ab        a
 -1        d
</pre>
It turns out you need 2 checkers to get to level 1, 4 to get to
level 2, 8 to 
get to level 3, 20 to get to level 4, but it is impossible to get
to level 5.  
The question is to prove that it is impossible to get to level 5.

You are a cook in a remote area with no clocks or other way of
keeping time

You do have 
a stove however with water in a pot already boiling.  Somebody
asks you for a 
9 minute egg, and you know this

undercook or overcook 
the eggs by even a few seconds.  What is the least amount of time
it will 
take to prepare the egg?
