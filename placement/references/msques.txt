12. Implement the function : node * add(node *l1, node *l2). The lists L1 and L2 are linked lists where each node of the linked list contains a single hexadecimal digit, represented as a char. The whole list thus represents a hexadecimal number. We had to add the two hex numbers represented in l1 and l2, and return the head of the linked list representing the answer.
13. You are given a binary tree where each node consists of a left pointer, a right pointer, and a sibling pointer. The left and right pointers are initially populated and the tree is a normal binary tree. He wanted a function to populate the sibling pointers such that they point to the node to the right of the current node in the tree, and which is on the same level. If there is no such node, the sibling pointer must be set to NULL. He again wanted an optimized solution, optimized for space.

This representation is similar to binary representation. Instead of powers of 2, Fibonacci numbers are used. The question was, given n find all possible representations of n in Fibonacci binary number system. as 10=8+2=>10010 also 10=5+3+2=>1110

53. Write a program to determine whether n/2 distinctive pairs can be formed from given n integers where n is even and each pair's sum is divisible by given k. Numbers cannot be repeated in the pairs, that means only you can form total n/2 pairs. 54.Given a m-word dictionary and a n-sized word. Suggest DS for dictionary such that you can find out all the anagrams of the given word present in dictionary… 55. There are only four operations you can do on a variable. a) You can set a variable to 0. b) You can set a variable = another variable. c) You can increment a variable(only by 1), and its a post increment. d) You can loop. So, if you were to say loop(v1) and v1 = 10, your loop would execute 10 times, but the value in v1 wouldn’t change so the first line in the loop can change value of v1 without chaning the no of times you loop. You need to do 2 things. (i) Write a function that decrements by 1. (ii) Write a function that subtracts one variable from another. 56.

Now there are many threads that are reading and writing in this memory locations at any time 0t 1t 2t … and so on. For ex a thread no.4 is writing to memory location 512 at time 3t. So we get a quadruple {4,512,W,3t}. Suppose we have lot of quadruples for lots of threads.At any particular time we have to tell which of the threads are doing memory clash. Memory clash is defined as two thread accessing same memory location with time difference less than equal to 5 and atleast one of the thread is doing write operation. That interviewer didnt needed the code bt the approach.I first told him to hash the threads based on memory location and search for memory clash threads for that memory location,bt he was not understanding how it can be implemented for large no. of threads. 71.
